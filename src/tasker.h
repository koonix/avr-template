 *
 * brief: This is a really simple, non-preemptive (co-operative) task scheduler.
 * You can register tasks with their runnable function and the periodic
 * time you want to call them. With a help of a timer the tasks get into READY
 * state after every time period (except if they are PAUSED) and they get
 * called and executed in the main()'s inifinte loop. After they are finished
 * everything starts over. This Scheduler helps you to keep your tasks and
 * timing organized.
